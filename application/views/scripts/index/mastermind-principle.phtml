<p><strong>MasterMind Principle </strong></p> 
<p><strong>By Napoleon Hill</strong></p> 
<p>Do you want to be successful in your chosen occupation, if so, read on to have a better understanding of the Mastermind, the principle of success, as espoused by Napoleon Hill.</p> 
<p>The MasterMind Principle is the second of seventeen principles in Napoleon Hill's book; "Think and Grow Rich". Napoleon Hill explains that, "an understandable definition of the MasterMind is this; it consists of two or more individuals <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">working in perfect harmony</span></em> <em>towards the attainment of a definite purpose</em>." <em>(Italics are ours) </em>He provides some interesting facts about the MasterMind and how it can give you an idea of how important it is and how necessary it is for you to embrace this principle if you want to attain success in your chosen occupation. It is a principle through which you may borrow and use, the education, experience, influence and perhaps the capital of other people, in carrying out your own plans in life." Napoleon Hill continues that it is "the principle through which you can <em>accomplish in one year</em>, more than you can accomplish without it in a life time, if you depend entirely on your own effort."</p> 
<p>Note with importance, that Napoleon Hill says, "When you form a true MasterMind Alliance which is in perfect harmony with others; you could draw on the spiritual forces within you. Furthermore, it provides absolute protection against failure, provided the purpose of using these principles is beneficial to all those you influence." He goes on to add how the Ford Empire was started by a MasterMind Alliance between Henry Ford and his wife. Henry Ford, despite his shyness and lack of confidence, but through the encouragement, inspiration and support of his MasterMind Alliance partner, his wife, went on to become one of America's foremost industrialist.</p> 
<p>For people like us, salaried individuals, forming Mastermind Alliances with our colleagues and managers, offers us opportunities towards the attainment of higher incomes and more responsible positions. Napoleon Hill recommends that we do the following three things even before forming our MasterMind Alliances:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Decide where you wish to be and what you wish to be doing over the next three (03) years</li> 
<li>Decide how much money you desire to be making and what you're going to do to earn it</li> 
<li>Form a MasterMind Alliance with one family member and one other person who is seeking your services</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Napoleon Hill advises us, to control our mental attitude and to make ourselves "friendly and agreeable with everyone with whom we are closely associated, if we are to expect friendly cooperation in return." He goes on to say that a "negative mental attitude brings nothing but failure." He reminds us that we are "always where we are and what we are because of our mental attitude and that our mental attitude is the only thing we have complete control over."</p> 
<p>On the question of success, Napoleon Hill emphatically states that "success has to be planned and that it has to be earned in advance." More importantly, he reminds us that the higher bracket of achievements can only be attained, if we are able to take others along with us. Success is getting whatever we want from life, without having to violate the rights of others but by helping others to acquire it.</p> 
<p>In closing, Napoleon Hill makes this powerful statement; "The only real limitation is the one you accept and set-up in your own mind."</p>

 <strong>MasterMind Guidelines</strong> 
 
1.  The average group works best with two to eight members, no more than 12 – time is the constraint.

2. Meet regularly, weekly if possible. Meet in a nice place, preferably inspirational place if possible. Make sure it's a well-lit restaurant, office, home, library, or church, etc. Have a preplanned agenda.

3.  If you are in different cities, the meeting can be conducted on a conference call. Make certain you engage an excellent conference call company (setting up a series of 3-way calls does not work well.) You might save a few cents but miss a million dollar opportunity through distractions.

4.  Start the meetings by reading the MasterMind principles. This is possibly one of the most important points of call. Every member of the group should read aloud all 7 Principles and the Dedication and Covenant.

5.  Each member should be supported visually, verbally and emotionally by the others. For example: someone wants anew home. Other members might say, "I see you driving up to your glorious new home. I see you sunning yourself at poolside with your loved ones, friends, and me." The principle is that we believe for others what they cannot fully believe for themselves. These are not idle words. You must create and project to the MasterMind a clear vision that the words represent.

6. Your MasterMind call should run like a "Swiss Watch"." Ensure the call is timely. If you have committed to a 60 minute call, keep to it within that time frame. MasterMind members are generally extremely busy … time is important – use it wisely. Each group should elect MasterMind leader to keep everything flowing freely. The leadership position can rotate from one member to another. The group leader should be prepared to time each person's participation in the call to ensure it is kept on track. Have a watch (with a second hand) or stop watch available. This point is extremely important (do not treat it lightly).

7. Roll Call – The group leader would take a roll call and would assign each person a number (i.e. if there are 6 people on the call, each person would have a number from 1 – 6). This number system can be used to designate who speaks when and should rotate with each call to ensure the #1 person doesn't always speak first.

8. Good News – Starting with whichever number is designated for that particular call; each person would be allowed 2 minutes to speak about something positive. They will share their "win for the week." This will help in creating the right vibration to get the call started in a positive direction.

9. Wants and Needs – Again, staring with whichever number has been designated to begin first, each person would have 10 minutes (the group would decide on the length of time) in which to state their wants and needs and receive their responses. It might sound like this, "This is John. This is what I want and this is what I need." Or, "This is John. This is a challenge I'm facing and I would appreciate the help of my MasterMind group." It's important that everybody understands that the designated amount of time allotted is both to state their want/need and to receive the group's response. Therefore, if 4 minutes has been designated to each person and someone is not prepared for the call and it takes them 3½ minutes to state what they need, it allows the group only ½ minute to respond. Each MasterMind member needs to be prepared for the call – to ensure maximum benefit. At the end of the 4 minutes, it would be the team leader's responsibility to say, "Time is up." The discussion would then come to a halt. The second person would be asked to begin.

10. Depending on the "chosen" length of your call, you may decide to leave the room for a "free for all" at the end, at which time anyone and everyone would have a chance to speak. 

<strong>MasterMind Principles</strong> 

<strong>I Begin Every MasterMind Meeting </strong> 

<strong>By Reading These Seven MasterMind Principles</strong> 

I Release: I release myself to the MasterMind because I am strong when I have others to help me

I Believe: I believe the combined intelligence of the MasterMind creates a wisdom far beyond my own

I Understand: I understand that I will more easily create positive results in my life when I am open to looking at myself and my problems opportunities from another's point of view

I Decide: I decide to release my desire totally in trust to the MasterMind and I am open to accepting new possibilities

I Forgive: I forgive myself for mistakes I have made. I also forgive others who have hurt me in the past so I can move into the future with a clean slate

I Ask: I ask the MasterMind to hear what I really want; my goals, my dreams and my desires, and I hear my MasterMind partners supporting me in MY fulfillment

I Accept: I know, relax and accept; believing that the working power of the MasterMind will respond to my every need. I am grateful knowing this is so

<strong>Dedication and Covenant</strong> 

"I now have a covenant in which it is agreed that the MasterMind

shall supply me with an abundance of all things necessary

to live a success-filled and happy life.

I dedicate  myself to be of maximum service to God and my fellow human beings,

to live in a manner that will set the highest example

for others to follow and to remain an open channel of God's will.

I go forth with a spirit of enthusiasm, excitement and expectancy."
